# Basic Introduction
This project is part of the FPGA-Based Design Methodology for Advanced Digital Systems course, offered by the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University in China.

In this project, I aim to implement a basic simulation of the Efficient Inference Engine (EIE), as described in the paper [*"EIE: Efficient Inference Engine on Compressed Deep Neural Network"* (S. Han et al., ISCA 2016)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7551397) This implementation does not involve hardware; it consists solely of Verilog and Python code.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the inherent sparsity in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accelerate computation and reduce memory usage.

# Disclaimer

This project is a **reproduction** of the concepts and methods presented in the paper [*"EIE: Efficient Inference Engine on Compressed Deep Neural Network"* (S. Han et al., ISCA 2016)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7551397). It is part of the **FPGA-Based Design Methodology for Advanced Digital Systems** course at **Tsinghua University**. The implementation is intended for educational purposes only and is not an original work.

The code and materials provided here aim to demonstrate an understanding of the ideas discussed in the paper. While we have made every effort to ensure correctness, there may still be errors or omissions. Users are responsible for verifying the results and using this code at their own risk.
